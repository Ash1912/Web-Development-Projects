    <h1 style="font-size:20pt;"><i><span>Why should you use inline CSS ?</span></i></h1>
    Inline CSS is considered useful as it reduces the number of files that the browser needs to download before displaying the web page. With an external CSS, the browser first loads an HTML file and then downloads the CSS file. With an inline CSS, you just need to download one HTML file instead of 2, making the process faster.<br>
    One of the disadvantages of inline CSS is that the files are not cached and each visit to the browser is treated as fresh and acted upon when a visitor goes to another page. Caching is a better choice if the project is complex.<br>
    If you ask us why inline CSS has a priority, there are two reasons:<br>
    * To implement at a small number of style definitions, inline CSS is your go-to method.<br>
    * At the local level, it has the ability to override other style specification methods.
